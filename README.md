# Go-Find-Me
Search User Names on a variety of sites based on the work of Micah Hoffman (@WebBreacher)

Note that any successful links are copied into a CSV file for verification of the username being associated with the person whose name you searched on. This is automatically copied into the same directory where you ran your script from.

## Please note that this is a work in progress and more info will be added to the Readme when time allows - thanks!
