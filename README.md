Note that any successful links are copied into a CSV file named `userResults.csv` for verification of the username being associated with the person whose name you searched on. This is automatically copied into the same directory where you ran your script from.

## Please note that this is a work in progress and more info will be added to the Readme when time allows - thanks!
